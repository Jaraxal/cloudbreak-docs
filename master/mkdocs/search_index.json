These two accounts are usually  the same  when the end user is the same who deployed the Cloudbreak server, but it allows Cloudbreak to act as a SaaS project as well if needed.

These are the same blueprints that are \nused by Ambari\n.\n\n\nYou can use the 3 default blueprints pre-defined in Cloudbreak or you can create your own.\nBlueprints can be added from an URL (an example \nblueprint\n) or the whole JSON can be copied to the \nManual copy\n field.\n\n\nThe hostgroups added in the JSON will be mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster and the services and components defined in the hostgroup will be installed on the corresponding nodes.\nIt is not necessary to define all the configuration fields in the blueprints - if a configuration is missing, Ambari will fill that with a default value.\nThe configurations defined in the blueprint can also be modified later from the Ambari UI.\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this blueprint to create clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\n\n\nA blueprint can be exported from a running Ambari cluster that can be reused in Cloudbreak with slight modifications.\nThere is no automatic way to modify an exported blueprint and make it instantly usable in Cloudbreak, the modifications have to be done manually.\nWhen the blueprint is exported some configurations will have hardcoded for example domain names, or memory configurations that won't be applicable to the Cloudbreak cluster.\n\n\nCluster customization\n\n\nSometimes it can be useful to define some custom scripts that run during cluster creation and add some additional functionality.\nFor example it can be a service you'd like to install but it's not supported by Ambari or some script that automatically downloads some data to the necessary nodes.\nThe most notable example is Ranger setup: it has a prerequisite of a running database when Ranger Admin is installing.\nA PostgreSQL database can be easily started and configured with a recipe before the blueprint installation starts.\n\n\nTo learn more about these so called \nRecipes\n, and to check out the Ranger database recipe, take a look at the \nCluster customization\n part of the documentation.\n\n\nCluster deployment\n\n\nAfter all the templates are configured you can deploy a new HDP cluster. Start by selecting a previously created AWS credential in the header.\nClick on \ncreate cluster\n, give it a \nname\n, select a \nRegion\n where the cluster infrastructure will be provisioned and select one of the \nNetworks\n and \nSecurity Groups\n created earlier.\nAfter you've selected a \nBlueprint\n as well you should be able to configure the \nTemplate resources\n and the number of nodes for all of the hostgroups in the blueprint.\n\n\nIf \nPublic in account\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the newly created cluster on the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.\n\n\nIf \nEnable security\n is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the cluster will be Kerberized. See more about it in the \nKerberos\n section of this documentation.\n\n\nAfter the \ncreate and start cluster\n button is pushed Cloudbreak will start to create resources on your AWS account.\nCloudbreak uses \nCloudFormation\n to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on the AWS Console under the CloudFormation page.\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n Always use Cloudbreak to delete the cluster. If that fails for some reason always try to delete the \nCloudFormation stack first.\nInstances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced options\n\n\nThere are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:\n\n\nAvailability Zone\n: You can restrict the instances to a specific availability zone. It may be useful if you're using reserved instances.\n\n\nUse dedicated instances:\n You can use \ndedicated instances\n on EC2\n\n\nMinimum cluster size:\n the provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider cannot allocate all the requested nodes\n\n\nValidate blueprint:\n feature to validate the Ambari blueprint. By default is switched on.\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nCongrats! Your cluster should now be up and running. To learn more about it we have some \ninteresting insights\n about Cloudbreak clusters.",

Resources  Resources describe the instances of your cluster - the instance type and the attached volumes.\nA typical setup is to combine multiple resources in a cluster for the different types of nodes.\nFor example you may want to attach multiple large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.  There are some additional configuration options here:   Spot price (USD)  is not mandatory, if specified Cloudbreak will request spot price instances (which might take a while or never be fulfilled by Amazon). This option is  not supported  by the default RedHat images.  EBS encryption  is supported for all volume types. If this option is checked then all the attached disks  will be encrypted  by Amazon using the AWS KMS master keys.  If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.    Networks  Your clusters can be created in their own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or in one of your already existing VPCs.\nCurrently Cloudbreak creates a new subnet in both cases, in a later release it may change.\nThe subnet's IP range must be defined in the  Subnet (CIDR)  field using the general CIDR notation.  If you don't want to use your already existing VPC, you can use the default network ( default-aws-network ) for all your clusters.\nIt will create a new VPC with a  10.0.0.0/16  subnet every time a cluster is created.  If you'd like to deploy a cluster to an already existing VPC you'll have to create a new network template where you configure the identifier of your VPC and the internet gateway (IGW) that's attached to the VPC.\nIn this case you'll have to create a different network template for every one of your clusters because the Subnet CIDR cannot overlap an already existing subnet in the VPC.\nFor example you can create 3 different clusters with 3 different network templates for the subnets  10.0.0.0/24 ,  10.0.1.0/24 ,  10.0.2.0/24  but with the same VPC and IGW identifiers.   Important  Please make sure that the subnet you define here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed \nsubnets in the VPC because the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.   If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template to create clusters, but cannot delete or modify it.   Note  that the VPCs, IGWs and/or subnets are  not created  on AWS after the  Create Network  button is pushed, \nonly after the cluster provisioning starts with the selected network template.    Security groups  Security group templates are very similar to the security groups on the AWS Console.\nThey describe the allowed inbound traffic to the instances in the cluster.\nCurrently only one security group template can be selected for a Cloudbreak cluster and all the instances have a public IP address so all the instances in the cluster will belong to the same security group.\nThis may change in a later release.

Start by selecting a previously created AWS credential in the header.\nClick on  create cluster , give it a  name , select a  Region  where the cluster infrastructure will be provisioned and select one of the  Networks  and  Security Groups  created earlier.\nAfter you've selected a  Blueprint  as well you should be able to configure the  Template resources  and the number of nodes for all of the hostgroups in the blueprint.  If  Public in account  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to see the newly created cluster on the UI, but cannot delete or modify it.  If  Enable security  is checked as well, Cloudbreak will install Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the cluster will be Kerberized. See more about it in the  Kerberos  section of this documentation.  After the  create and start cluster  button is pushed Cloudbreak will start to create resources on your AWS account.\nCloudbreak uses  CloudFormation  to create the resources - you can check out the resources created by Cloudbreak on the AWS Console under the CloudFormation page.   Important  Always use Cloudbreak to delete the cluster. If that fails for some reason always try to delete the \nCloudFormation stack first.\nInstances are started in an Auto Scaling Group so they may be restarted if you terminate an instance manually!   Advanced options  There are some advanced features when deploying a new cluster, these are the following:  Availability Zone : You can restrict the instances to a specific availability zone. It may be useful if you're using reserved instances.  Use dedicated instances:  You can use  dedicated instances  on EC2  Minimum cluster size:  the provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider cannot allocate all the requested nodes  Validate blueprint:  feature to validate the Ambari blueprint.

Hadoop has built-in support for the \nWASB filesystem\n so it can be used easily as HDFS instead of disks.\n\n\nDisks and blob storage\n\n\nIn Azure every data disk attached to a virtual machine \nis stored\n as a virtual hard disk (VHD) in a page blob inside an Azure storage account. Because these are not local disks and the operations must be done on the VHD files it causes degraded performance when used as HDFS.\nWhen WASB is used as a Hadoop filesystem the files are full-value blobs in a storage account. It means better performance compared to the data disks and the WASB filesystem can be configured very easily but Azure storage accounts have their own \nlimitations\n as well. There is a space limitation for TB per storage account (500 TB) as well but the real bottleneck is the total request rate that is only 20000 IOPS where Azure will start to throw errors when trying to do an I/O operation.\nTo bypass those limits Microsoft created a small service called \nDASH\n. DASH itself is a service that imitates the API of the Azure Blob Storage API and it can be deployed as a Microsoft Azure Cloud Service. Because its API is the same as the standard blob storage API it can be used \nalmost\n in the same way as the default WASB filesystem from a Hadoop deployment.\nDASH works by sharding the storage access across multiple storage accounts. It can be configured to distribute storage account load to at most 15 \nscaleout\n storage accounts. It needs one more \nnamespace\n storage account where it keeps track of where the data is stored.\nWhen configuring a WASB filesystem with Hadoop, the only required config entries are the ones where the access details are described. To access a storage account Azure generates an access key that is displayed on the Azure portal or can be queried through the API while the account name is the name of the storage account itself. A DASH service has a similar account name and key, those can be configured in the configuration file while deploying the cloud service.\n\n\n\n\nDeploying a DASH service with Cloudbreak deployer\n\n\nWe have automated the deployment of a DASH service in cloudbreak-deployer. After cbd is installed, simply run the following command to deploy a DASH cloud service with 5 scale out storage accounts:\n\n\ncbd azure deploy-dash --accounts 5 --prefix dash --location \nWest Europe\n --instances 3\n\n\n\n\nThe command first creates the namespace account and the scaleout storage accounts, builds the \n.cscfg\n configuration file based on the created storage account names and keys, generates an Account Name and an Account Key for the DASH service and finally deploys the cloud service package file to a new cloud service.\n\n\nThe WASB filesystem configured with DASH can be used as a data lake - when multiple clusters are deployed with the same DASH filesystem configuration the same data can be accessed from all the clusters, but every cluster can have a different service configured as well. In that case deploy as many DASH services with cbd as clusters with Cloudbreak and configure them accordingly.\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nAfter these prerequisites are done you can move on to create clusters on the \nUI\n or with the \nShell\n.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n Make sure that your cloud account can launch instances using the new Azure ARM *(a.k.a. V2) API and you have sufficient qouta (CPU, network, etc) for the requested cluster size.",

Deploying a DASH service with Cloudbreak deployer  We have automated the deployment of a DASH service in cloudbreak-deployer. After cbd is installed, simply run the following command to deploy a DASH cloud service with 5 scale out storage accounts:  cbd azure deploy-dash --accounts 5 --prefix dash --location  West Europe  --instances 3  The command first creates the namespace account and the scaleout storage accounts, builds the  .cscfg  configuration file based on the created storage account names and keys, generates an Account Name and an Account Key for the DASH service and finally deploys the cloud service package file to a new cloud service.  The WASB filesystem configured with DASH can be used as a data lake - when multiple clusters are deployed with the same DASH filesystem configuration the same data can be accessed from all the clusters, but every cluster can have a different service configured as well. In that case deploy as many DASH services with cbd as clusters with Cloudbreak and configure them accordingly.",

For example if your  cbd  working directory is  ~/prj/cbd  then copy your blueprint and public ssh key file into this directory. You can refer to these files with their names from the shell.  Create a cloud credential  credential create --OPENSTACK --name my-os-credential --description  credentail description  --userName  OpenStack username  --password  OpenStack password  --tenantName  OpenStack tenant name  --endPoint  OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone) endpoint  --sshKeyPath  path of your public SSH key file   Alternatively you can upload your public key from an url as well, by using the  \u2014sshKeyUrl  switch. You can check whether the credential was created successfully by using the  credential list  command. You can switch between your cloud credentials - when you\u2019d like to use one and act with that you will have to use:  credential select --name my-openstack-credential  Create a template  A template gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of cloud infrastructure related resources, maintaining and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. A template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a new stack).  template create --OPENSTACK --name ostemplate --description openstack-template --instanceType m1.large --volumeSize 100 --volumeCount 2  You can check whether the template was created successfully by using the  template list  or  template show  command.  You can delete your cloud template - when you\u2019d like to delete one you will have to use:  template delete --name ostemplate  Create or select a blueprint  You can define Ambari blueprints with cloudbreak-shell:  blueprint add --name myblueprint --description myblueprint-description --file  the path of the blueprint   Other available options:  --url  the url of the blueprint  --publicInAccount  flags if the network is public in the account  We ship default Ambari blueprints with Cloudbreak. You can use these blueprints or add yours. To see the available blueprints and use one of them please use:  blueprint list\n\nblueprint select --name hdp-small-default  Create a network  A network gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of cloud infrastructure related networking, maintaining and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. A network can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a new stack).  network create --OPENSTACK --name osnetwork --description openstack-network --publicNetID  id of an OpenStack public network  --subnet 10.0.0.0/16  Other available options:  --publicInAccount  flags if the network is public in the account  You can check whether the network was created successfully by using the  network list  command. Check the network and select it if you are happy with it:  network show --name osnetwork\n\nnetwork select --name osnetwork  Create a security group  A security group gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of cloud infrastructure related security rules.  securitygroup create --name secgroup_example --description securitygroup-example --rules 0.0.0.0/0:tcp:8080,9090;10.0.33.0/24:tcp:1234,1235  You can check whether the security group was created successfully by using the  securitygroup list  command. Check the security group and select it if you are happy with it:  securitygroup show --name secgroup_example\n\nsecuritygroup select --name secgroup_example  There are two default security groups defined:  all-services-port  and  only-ssh-and-ssl  only-ssh-and-ssl:  all ports are locked down (you can't access Hadoop services outside of the Virtual Private Cloud)   SSH (22)  HTTPS (443)   all-services-port:  all Hadoop services + SSH/gateway HTTPS are accessible by default:   SSH (22)  HTTPS (443)  Ambari (8080)  Consul (8500)  NN (50070)  RM Web (8088)  Scheduler (8030RM)  IPC (8050RM)  Job history server (19888)  HBase master (60000)  HBase master web (60010)  HBase RS (16020)  HBase RS info (60030)  Falcon (15000)  Storm (8744)  Hive metastore (9083)  Hive server (10000)  Hive server HTTP (10001)  Accumulo master (9999)  Accumulo Tserver (9997)  Atlas (21000)  KNOX (8443)  Oozie (11000)  Spark HS (18080)  NM Web (8042)  Zeppelin WebSocket (9996)  Zeppelin UI (9995)  Kibana (3080)  Elasticsearch (9200)   Configure instance groups  You have to configure the instancegroups before the provisioning. An instancegroup is defining a group of your nodes with a specified template. Usually we create instancegroups for the hostgroups defined in the blueprints.  instancegroup configure --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --nodecount 3 --templateName ostemplate  Other available options:  --templateId  Id of the template  Create a Hadoop cluster  You are almost done - two more command and this will create your Hadoop cluster on your favorite cloud provider. Same as the API, or UI this will use your  credential ,  instancegroups ,  network ,  securitygroup , and by using OpenStack Heat will launch a cloud stack  stack create --name my-first-stack --region local  Once the  stack  is up and running (cloud provisioning is done) it will use your selected  blueprint  and install your custom Hadoop cluster with the selected components and services.  cluster create --description  my first cluster   You are done - you can check the progress through the Ambari UI. If you log back to Cloudbreak UI you can check the progress over there as well, and learn the IP address of Ambari.  Stop/Restart cluster and stack  You have the ability to  stop your existing stack then its cluster  if you want to suspend the work on it.  Select a stack for example with its name:  stack select --name my-stack  Other available option to define a stack is its  --id  (instead of the  --name ).  Apply the following commands to stop the previously selected stack:  cluster stop\nstack stop   Important!  The related cluster should be stopped before you can stop the stack.   Apply the following command to  restart the previously selected and stopped stack :  stack start  After the selected stack has restarted, you can  restart the related cluster as well :  cluster start  Upscale/Downscale cluster and stack  You can  upscale your selected stack  if you need more instances to your infrastructure:  stack node --ADD --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6  Other available options:  --withClusterUpScale  indicates cluster upscale after stack upscale\nor you can upscale the related cluster separately as well:  cluster node --ADD --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment 6  Apply the following command to  downscale the previously selected stack :  stack node --REMOVE  --instanceGroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2  and the related cluster separately:  cluster node --REMOVE  --hostgroup host_group_slave_1 --adjustment -2",

Cloudbreak built in provisioning doesn't contain every use case, so we are introducing the concept of recipes.\n\n\nRecipes are basically script extensions to a cluster that run on a set of nodes before or after the Ambari cluster installation. With recipes it's quite easy for example to put a JAR file on the Hadoop classpath or run some custom scripts.\n\n\nIn Cloudbreak we supports two ways to configure recipe, we have downloadable and stored recipes.\n\n\nStored recipes\n\n\nAs the name mentions stored recipes are uploaded and stored in Cloudbreak via web interface or shell.\n\n\nThe easiest way to create a custom recipe:\n\n\n\n\ncreate your own pre and/or post scripts\n\n\nupload them on shell or web interface\n\n\n\n\nAdd recipe\n\n\nOn the web interface under \"manage recipes\" section you should create new recipe. Please select SCRIPT or FILE type plugin, and fill other required fields.\n\n\nTo add recipe via shell use the following command:\n\n\nrecipe store --name [recipe-name] --executionType [ONE_NODE|ALL_NODES] --preInstallScriptFile /path/of/the/pre-install-script --postInstallScriptFile /path/of/the/post-install-script\n\n\n\n\nThis command has optional parameters:\n\n\n--description\n \"string\" description of the recipe\n\n\n--timeout\n \"integer\" timeout of the script execution\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n \"flag\" flags if the template is public in the account\n\n\nIn the background Cloudbreak pushes recipe to Consul key/value store during cluster creation.\n\n\nNote\n Stored recipes has limitation on size, because they are stored in Consul key/value store, the base64 encoded content of the scripts must be less than 512kB.\n\n\nDownloadable recipes\n\n\nA downloadable recipe should be available on HTTP, HTTPS protocols optionally with basic authentication, or any kind of public Git repository.\n\n\nThis kind of recipe must contain a plugin.toml file, with some basic information about the recipe. Besides this at least a recipe-pre-install or a recipe-post-install script.\n\n\nContent of plugin.toml:\n\n\n[plugin]\nname = \n[recipe-name]\n\ndescription = \n[description-of-the-recipe]\n\nversion = \n1.0\n\nmaintainer_name = \n[maintainer-name]\n\nmaintainer_email = \n[maintainer-email]\n\nwebsite_url = \n[website-url]\n\n\n\n\n\nPre- and post scripts are regular shell scripts, and must be executable.\n\n\nTo configure recipe or recipe groups in Cloudbreak you have to create a descriptive JSON file and send it to Cloudbreak via our shell. On web interface you don't need to take care of this file.\n\n\n{\n  \nname\n: \n[recipe-name]\n,\n  \ndescription\n: \n[description-of-the-recipe]\n,\n  \nproperties\n: {\n    \n[key]\n: \n[value]\n\n  },\n  \nplugins\n: {\n      \ngit://github.com/account/recipe.git\n: \nONE_NODE\n\n      \nhttp://user:password@mydomain.com/my-recipe.tar\n: \nALL_NODES\n\n      \nhttps://mydomain.com/my-recipe.zip\n: \nALL_NODES\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAt this point we need to understand some element of the JSON above.\n\n\nFirst of all \nproperties\n. Properties are saved to Consul key/value store, and they are available from the pre or post script by fetching http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/[key]?raw. The limitation of the value's base64 representation is 512kB. This option is a good choice if you want to write reusable recipes.\n\n\nThe next one is \nplugins\n. As you read before we support a few kind of protocols, and each of them has their own limitations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGit\n\n\n\n\ngit repository must be public (or available from the cluster)\n\n\nthe recipe files must be on the root\n\n\nonly repository default branch supported, there is no opportunity to check out different branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTP(S)\n\n\n\n\non this kind of protocols you have to bundle your recipe into a tar or zip file\n\n\nbasic authentication is the only way to protect recipe from public\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast one is the execution type of the recipe. We supports two options:\n\n\n\n\nONE_NODE means the recipe will execute only one node in the hostgroup\n\n\nAll_NODES runs every single instance in the hostgroup.\n\n\n\n\nAdd recipe\n\n\nOn the web interface please select URL type plugin, and fill other required fields.\n\n\nTo add recipe via shell use the command(s) below:\n\n\nrecipe add --file /path/of/the/recipe/json\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nrecipe add --url http(s)://mydomain.com/my-recipe.json\n\n\n\n\nAdd command has an optional parameter\n\n\n--publicInAccount\n is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this recipe for create clusters, but cannot delete it.\n\n\nSample recipe for Ranger\n\n\nTo be able to install Ranger from a blueprint, a database must be running when Ambari starts to install Ranger Admin. With Cloudbreak a database can be configured and started from a recipe. We've created a sample recipe that can be used to initialize and start a PostgreSQL database that will be able to accept connections from Ranger and store its data. Add the \nONE_NODE\n recipe from \nthis URL\n on the Cloudbreak UI:\n\n\n\n\nAnd add this recipe to the same hostgroup where Ranger Admin is installed on the 'Choose Blueprint' when creating a new cluster:\n\n\n\n\nRanger installation also has some required properties that must be added to the blueprint. We've created a sample one-node blueprint with the necessary configurations to install Ranger Admin and Ranger Usersync. The configuration values in this blueprint match the sample recipe above - they are set to use a PostgreSQL database on the same host where Ranger Admin is installed. Usersync is configured to use UNIX as the authentication method and it should also be installed on the same host where Ranger Admin is installed.\n\n\n{\n  \nconfigurations\n: [\n    {\n

Cloudbreak built in provisioning doesn't contain every use case, so we are introducing the concept of recipes.  Recipes are basically script extensions to a cluster that run on a set of nodes before or after the Ambari cluster installation. With recipes it's quite easy for example to put a JAR file on the Hadoop classpath or run some custom scripts.

Please select SCRIPT or FILE type plugin, and fill other required fields.  To add recipe via shell use the following command:  recipe store --name [recipe-name] --executionType [ONE_NODE|ALL_NODES] --preInstallScriptFile /path/of/the/pre-install-script --postInstallScriptFile /path/of/the/post-install-script  This command has optional parameters:  --description  \"string\" description of the recipe  --timeout  \"integer\" timeout of the script execution  --publicInAccount  \"flag\" flags if the template is public in the account  In the background Cloudbreak pushes recipe to Consul key/value store during cluster creation.

To configure recipe or recipe groups in Cloudbreak you have to create a descriptive JSON file and send it to Cloudbreak via our shell.

The limitation of the value's base64 representation is 512kB. This option is a good choice if you want to write reusable recipes.  The next one is  plugins . As you read before we support a few kind of protocols, and each of them has their own limitations:    Git   git repository must be public (or available from the cluster)  the recipe files must be on the root  only repository default branch supported, there is no opportunity to check out different branch     HTTP(S)   on this kind of protocols you have to bundle your recipe into a tar or zip file  basic authentication is the only way to protect recipe from public     Last one is the execution type of the recipe. We supports two options:   ONE_NODE means the recipe will execute only one node in the hostgroup  All_NODES runs every single instance in the hostgroup.   Add recipe  On the web interface please select URL type plugin, and fill other required fields.  To add recipe via shell use the command(s) below:  recipe add --file /path/of/the/recipe/json  or  recipe add --url http(s)://mydomain.com/my-recipe.json  Add command has an optional parameter  --publicInAccount  is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this recipe for create clusters, but cannot delete it.",

For further information please check the \nHelper functions\n section. Alternatively you watch the Ambari logs on the host instance as well under the \n`/hadoopfs/fs1/logs\n folder as well.\n\n\nAmbari database\n\n\nAmbari's database runs on the \ncbgateway\n node inside a PostgreSQL docker container.

An  scp  Example:  $ scp -qr -i ~/.ssh/private-key.pem ~/tmp/data cloudbreak@ client-node :/hadoopfs/fs1\n$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/private-key.pem cloudbreak@ client-node \n[cloudbreak@vmhostgroupclient11 ~]$ sudo docker exec -it $(sudo docker ps -f=name=ambari-agent -q) bash\n[root@docker-ambari tmp]# su hdfs\n[hdfs@docker-ambari tmp]# hadoop fs -put /hadoopfs/fs1/data /tmp\n[hdfs@docker-ambari tmp]# hadoop fs -ls /tmp\nFound 2 items\ndrwxr-xr-x   - hdfs supergroup          0 2015-10-21 13:46 /tmp/data\ndrwx-wx-wx   - hive supergroup          0 2015-10-21 08:51 /tmp/hive  Internal hostnames  After a cluster is created with Cloudbreak, the nodes will have internal hostnames like this:  vmhostgroupclient11.node.dc1.consul  This is because Cloudbreak uses  Consul  to provide DNS services.\nIt means that you won't see entries to the other nodes inside the  /etc/hosts  file, because nodes are registered inside Consul and the hostnames are resolved by Consul as well.  In the current version the  node.dc1.consul  domain is hardcoded and cannot be changed.  Accessing Ambari server from the other nodes  Ambari server is registered as a service in Consul, so it can always be accessed through its domain name  ambari-8080.service.consul  from the other ambari containers.\nIt can be tried by pinging it from one of the  ambari-agent  containers:  ping ambari-8080.service.consul  Cloudbreak gateway node  With every Cloudbreak cluster installation there is a special node called  cbgateway  started that won't run an ambari-agent container so it won't run HDP services either.\nIt can be seen on the Cloudbreak UI among the hostgroups when creating a cluster, but its node count cannot be changed from 1 and it shouldn't be there in the Ambari blueprint.\nIt is by design because this instance has some special tasks:   it runs the Ambari server and its database inside Docker containers  it runs an nginx proxy that is used by the Cloudbreak API to communicate with the cluster securely  it runs the Swarm manager that orchestrates the Docker containers on the whole cluster  it runs the Baywatch server that is responsible for collecting the operational logs from the cluster  it runs a Kerberos KDC container if Kerberos is configured   Logs  Hadoop logs  Hadoop logs are available from the host and from the container as well in the  /hadoopfs/fs1/logs  directory.  Ambari logs  For Ambari logs you can use our helper function,  ambari-log . For further information please check the  Helper functions  section. Alternatively you watch the Ambari logs on the host instance as well under the  `/hadoopfs/fs1/logs  folder as well.  Ambari database  Ambari's database runs on the  cbgateway  node inside a PostgreSQL docker container. To access it SSH to the  gateway  node and run the following command:  [cloudbreak@vmcbgateway0 ~]$ sudo docker exec -it ambari_db psql -U postgres",

Please note that the full path needs to be configured and env variables like $USER cannot be used.\n\n\nexport CB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION=/Users/myusername/prj/cloudbreak/core/src/main/resources/schema\n\n\n\n\nIn order to kill Cloudbreak container running inside the boot2docker and redirect the Cloudbreak related traffic to the Cloudbreak running in IDEA use the followig command:\n\n\ncbd util local-dev\n\n\n\n\nIDEA\n\n\nCloudbreak can be imported into IDEA as gradle project. Once it is done, you need to import the proper code formatter by using the \nFile -\n Import Settings...\n menu and selecting the \nidea_settings.jar\n located in the \nconfig\n directory in Cloudbreak git repository.\n\n\nTo launch the Cloudbreak application execute the \ncom.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.CloudbreakApplication\n class with VM options:\n\n\n-XX:MaxPermSize=1024m\n-Dcb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\n-Dcb.client.id=cloudbreak\n-Dcb.client.secret=cbsecret2015\n-Dcb.db.port.5432.tcp.addr=192.168.59.103\n-Dcb.db.port.5432.tcp.port=5432\n-Dcb.identity.server.url=http://192.168.59.103:8089\n-Dserver.port=9091\n\n\n\n\nThe \n-Dcb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\n value above needs to be replaced with the full path of \ncerts\n directory generated by Cloudbreak Deployer e.g. \n-Dcb.cert.dir=/Users/myusername/prj/cbd-local/certs\n\n\nCommand line\n\n\nTo run Cloudbreak from command line you have to create a property file, for example application.properties, with the content below, and execute \n./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.config.location=file:/path/of/property/application.properties\n command at project root.\n\n\ncb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\ncb.client.id=cloudbreak\ncb.client.secret=cbsecret2015\ncb.db.port.5432.tcp.addr=192.168.59.103\ncb.db.port.5432.tcp.port=5432\ncb.identity.server.url=http://192.168.59.103:8089\nserver.port=9091\n\n\n\n\nDatabase development\n\n\nIf schema change is required in Cloudbreak database (cbdb), then the developer needs to write SQL scripts to migrate the database accordingly. In Cloudbreak the schema migration is managed by \nMYBATIS Migrations\n and the cbd tool provides an easy-to-use wrapper for it. The syntax for using the migration commands is \ncbd migrate \ndatabase name\n \ncommand\n [parameters]\n e.g. \ncbd migrate migrate status\n.\n\n\nCreate a SQL template for schema changes:\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb new \nCLOUD-123 schema change for new feature\n\n\n\n\n\nAs as result of the above command an SQL file template is generated under the path specified in \nCB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION\n environment variable, which is defined in Profile. The structure of the generated SQL template looks like the following:\n\n\n-- // CLOUD-123 schema change for new feature\n-- Migration SQL that makes the change goes here.\n\n\n\n-- //@UNDO\n-- SQL to undo the change goes here.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have implemented your SQLs then you can execute them with:\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb up\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to rollback the last SQL file, then just use the down command:\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb down\n\n\n\n\nOn order to check the status of database\n\n\ncbd migrate cbdb status\n\n#Every script that has not been executed will be marked as ...pending... in the output of status command:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- MyBatis Migrations - status\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nID             Applied At          Description\n================================================================================\n20150421140021 2015-07-08 10:04:28 create changelog\n20150421150000 2015-07-08 10:04:28 CLOUD-607 create baseline schema\n20150507121756 2015-07-08 10:04:28 CLOUD-576 change instancegrouptype hostgroup to core\n20151008090632    ...pending...

Please note that the full path needs to be configured and env variables like $USER cannot be used.  export CB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION=/Users/myusername/prj/cloudbreak/core/src/main/resources/schema  In order to kill Cloudbreak container running inside the boot2docker and redirect the Cloudbreak related traffic to the Cloudbreak running in IDEA use the followig command:  cbd util local-dev  IDEA  Cloudbreak can be imported into IDEA as gradle project. Once it is done, you need to import the proper code formatter by using the  File -  Import Settings...  menu and selecting the  idea_settings.jar  located in the  config  directory in Cloudbreak git repository.  To launch the Cloudbreak application execute the  com.sequenceiq.cloudbreak.CloudbreakApplication  class with VM options:  -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m\n-Dcb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\n-Dcb.client.id=cloudbreak\n-Dcb.client.secret=cbsecret2015\n-Dcb.db.port.5432.tcp.addr=192.168.59.103\n-Dcb.db.port.5432.tcp.port=5432\n-Dcb.identity.server.url=http://192.168.59.103:8089\n-Dserver.port=9091  The  -Dcb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD  value above needs to be replaced with the full path of  certs  directory generated by Cloudbreak Deployer e.g.  -Dcb.cert.dir=/Users/myusername/prj/cbd-local/certs  Command line  To run Cloudbreak from command line you have to create a property file, for example application.properties, with the content below, and execute  ./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.config.location=file:/path/of/property/application.properties  command at project root.  cb.cert.dir=FULL_PATH_OF_THE_CERTS_DIR_GENERATED_BY_CBD\ncb.client.id=cloudbreak\ncb.client.secret=cbsecret2015\ncb.db.port.5432.tcp.addr=192.168.59.103\ncb.db.port.5432.tcp.port=5432\ncb.identity.server.url=http://192.168.59.103:8089\nserver.port=9091  Database development  If schema change is required in Cloudbreak database (cbdb), then the developer needs to write SQL scripts to migrate the database accordingly. In Cloudbreak the schema migration is managed by  MYBATIS Migrations  and the cbd tool provides an easy-to-use wrapper for it. The syntax for using the migration commands is  cbd migrate  database name   command  [parameters]  e.g.  cbd migrate migrate status .  Create a SQL template for schema changes:  cbd migrate cbdb new  CLOUD-123 schema change for new feature   As as result of the above command an SQL file template is generated under the path specified in  CB_SCHEMA_SCRIPTS_LOCATION  environment variable, which is defined in Profile. The structure of the generated SQL template looks like the following:  -- // CLOUD-123 schema change for new feature\n-- Migration SQL that makes the change goes here.\n\n\n\n-- //@UNDO\n-- SQL to undo the change goes here.  Once you have implemented your SQLs then you can execute them with:  cbd migrate cbdb up  If you would like to rollback the last SQL file, then just use the down command:  cbd migrate cbdb down  On order to check the status of database  cbd migrate cbdb status\n\n#Every script that has not been executed will be marked as ...pending... in the output of status command:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- MyBatis Migrations - status\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nID             Applied At          Description\n================================================================================\n20150421140021 2015-07-08 10:04:28 create changelog\n20150421150000 2015-07-08 10:04:28 CLOUD-607 create baseline schema\n20150507121756 2015-07-08 10:04:28 CLOUD-576 change instancegrouptype hostgroup to core\n20151008090632    ...pending...
