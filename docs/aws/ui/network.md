#### Networks

Your clusters can be created in their own **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** or in one of your already existing VPCs.
If you choose an existing VPC it is possible to create a new subnet within the VPC or use an already existing one.
The subnet's IP range must be defined in the `Subnet (CIDR)` field using the general CIDR notation.

*Default AWS Network*

If you don't want to create or use your custom VPC, you can use the `default-aws-network` for all your
Cloudbreak clusters. It will create a new VPC with a `10.0.0.0/16` subnet every time a cluster is created.

*Custom AWS Network*

If you'd like to deploy a cluster to a custom VPC you'll have to **create a new network** template on the **manage
networks** panel.

You have the following options:

* **Create a new VPC and a new subnet**: Every time a cluster is created with this kind of network setup a new VPC and a new subnet with the specified IP range will be created for the instances on AWS.
* **Create a new subnet in an existing VPC**:  Use this kind of network setup if you already have a VPC on AWS where you'd like to put the Cloudbreak created cluster but you'd like to have a separate subnet for it. This setup is only supported for basic VPCs, where an Internet Gateway is configured and instances can have public IP addresses to access the Internet. If you have a specific VPC setup (VGW, NAT, private subnets, etc..) then only the third option can be used.
* **Use an existing subnet in an existing VPC**:  Use this kind of network setup if you have an existing VPC with one or more subnets on AWS and you'd like to start the instances of a cluster in one - or more - of those subnets. Use this setup if you have a specific VPC setup: you should first create the subnet(s) directly through AWS and provide their IDs here. The subnets could be even in different availability zones and you can set a single or a comma separated list of subnets in the 'Subnet Identifier' field. There are only two requirements for the subnets:
    - instances in the subnet should be able to reach the Internet to download yum packages (it can be done through a Virtual Gateway, a NAT instance, an Internet Gateway or any other setup)
    - the VM where Cloudbreak is deployed must be able to reach the instances in the cluster on port 443. (Itâ€™s in the same subnet, or through a router from another subnet)
    - **NOTE**: instances in the subnet doesn't need to have public IP addresses in this case

 You can configure the `Subnet Identifier` and the `Internet Gateway Identifier` (IGW) of your VPC.

>**IMPORTANT:** The subnet CIDR cannot overlap each other in a VPC. So you have to create different network
templates for every each clusters.

To create a new subnet within the VPC, provide the ID of the subnet which is in the existing VPC and your cluster
will be launched into that subnet. **For example** you can create 3 different clusters with 3 different network
templates for multiple subnets `10.0.0.0/24`, `10.0.1.0/24`, `10.0.2.0/24` with the same VPC and IGW identifiers.

>**IMPORTANT:** Make sure the define subnet here doesn't overlap with any of your already deployed subnet in
the VPC, because the validation only happens after the cluster creation starts.

>In case of existing subnet make sure you have enough room within your network space for the new instances.

If `Public in account` is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this network template
to create clusters, but cannot delete it.

>**NOTE:** The VPCs, IGWs and subnet are created on AWS only after the the cluster provisioning starts with the selected
network template.
