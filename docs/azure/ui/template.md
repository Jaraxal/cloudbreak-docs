**Templates**

Templates describe the **instances of your cluster** - the instance type and the attached volumes. A typical setup is
 to combine multiple templates in a cluster for the different types of nodes. For example you may want to attach multiple
 large disks to the datanodes or have memory optimized instances for Spark nodes.

The instance templates can be configured on the **manage templates** panel on the Cloudbreak Dashboard.

If `Public in account`is checked all the users belonging to your account will be able to use this resource to create 
clusters, but cannot delete it.
