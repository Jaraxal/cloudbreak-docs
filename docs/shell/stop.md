#### Stop Cluster

You have the ability to **stop your existing stack then its cluster** if you want to suspend the work on it.

Select a stack for example with its name:
```
stack select --name my-stack
```
Other available option to define a stack is its `--id`.

Every time you should stop the `cluster` first then the `stack`. So apply following commands to stop the previously 
selected stack:
```
cluster stop
stack stop
```
