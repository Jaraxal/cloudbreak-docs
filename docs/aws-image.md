# AWS Cloud Images

We have pre-built cloud images for AWS with the Cloudbreak Deployer pre-installed. You can launch the latest Cloudbreak Deployer image based on your region at the [AWS Management Console](https://aws
.amazon.com/console/).

> Alternatively, instead of using the pre-built cloud images for AWS, you can install Cloudbreak Deployer on your own VM. See [install the Cloudbreak Deployer](onprem.md) for more information.

Make sure you opened the following ports on your virtual machine:
 
 * SSH (22)
 * Ambari (8080)
 * Identity server (8089)
 * Cloudbreak GUI (3000)
 * User authentication (3001)
