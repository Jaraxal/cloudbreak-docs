# Google Cloud Images

We have pre-built cloud images for GCP with the Cloudbreak Deployer pre-installed. Following the steps will guide you through the provider specific configuration then launch.

> Alternatively, instead of using the pre-built cloud images, you can install Cloudbreak Deployer on your own VM. See [install the Cloudbreak Deployer](onprem.md) for more information.

## Configured Image

You can create the latest Cloudbreak deployer image on the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) with the help
 of the [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-shell/docs/).

Images are global resources, so they can be used across zones and projects.
