# OpenStack Cloud Images

> This feature is currently `TECHNICAL PREVIEW` and is available for the `OpenStack Juno` release.

We have pre-built cloud images for OpenStack with the Cloudbreak Deployer pre-installed. Following the steps will guide you through the provider specific configuration then launch.

> Alternatively, instead of using the pre-built cloud images, you can install Cloudbreak Deployer on your own VM. See [install the Cloudbreak Deployer](onprem.md) for more information.


You can download the latest pre-configured Cloudbreak deployer image for OpenStack with the following script in the 
following section.

Please make sure you opened the following ports on your virtual machine:
 
 * SSH (22)
 * Ambari (8080)
 * Identity server (8089)
 * Cloudbreak GUI (3000)
 * User authentication (3001)
